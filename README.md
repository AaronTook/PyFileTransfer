# PyFileTransfer
A simple file transfer system using Python sockets.

The server recieves files uploaded by the client, one file at a time, and one client at a time. This project currently has only been configured to work on localhost (127.0.0.1).

Future versions of this project may include additional features such as:
>> Support for non-localhost useage.
>> Public-key encryption for file transfer.
>> An improved command-line interface.
>> A GUI for both client and server.

This project is my most recent attempt at understanding sockets, a topic that I have struggled with in the past. Although it isn't much yet, I hope to continue working on it as my skills improve.

If you have any suggestions or tips, please let me know!
